# Business path

## Positioning

- Visual layer + decision layer on top of transaction data.

## Initial ICP

- Students and early-career professionals.
- Financial coaches.

## Monetization

- Freemium: CSV + mosaic + recurring + basic actions.
- Pro: bank sync, advanced forecasting, enrichment, group modes.
- B2B: coaching dashboards.

## Risk notes

- Handling bank data is sensitive: minimize storage, encrypt, and provide clear opt-in.
- Recommendations must remain explainable; avoid regulated "financial advice" positioning.
