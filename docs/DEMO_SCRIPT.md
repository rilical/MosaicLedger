# Demo Script (Rehearsal)

## Visa Track Segment (30s) (VISA-012)

1. Start at `/app` and click **Use Demo Data** (fail-safe path for judging).
2. Go to **Recurring**:
   - Call out: “We detect recurring charges and predict the next date.”
   - Crisp metric: “Next 30 days upcoming recurring total is shown here.”
   - Take one action: mark a subscription **Cancel** (Subscription Manager).
3. Go to **Plan**:
   - Call out: “This is deterministic decision support. No AI required for numbers.”
   - Crisp action: click **Use cap** on the top overspend category (e.g. Housing), and point to the
     ranked action list updating around that goal.
4. Close with one line:
   - “The mural is the primary UI, and the plan turns fragments into a ranked list of next actions
     with quantified monthly savings.”
