## Current Demo Path (must work)

2. `pnpm dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000/app`
4. Click `Use Demo Data`
5. Verify:
   - Mosaic renders with visible tiles
   - Recurring panel shows at least 1 detected item (demo dataset)
   - Plan panel shows ranked actions (demo dataset)

## Latest Changes

- (Write what changed, in one paragraph, per PR.)

## Known Risks / TODO
